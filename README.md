# github-workflows
I'll push the github action workflows that I'll use in my different projects to automate the Deployment.

Available Github Action Workflows

- Deploy ReactJS application to AWS S3 (`will be update soon with cloud front steps`)
- Deploy Strapi CMS to Heroku (`This can be used for any NodeJS project as well`)
- Deploy NodeJS Application to Heroku using Heroku Container Registry
- Deploy NodeJS Application to Digital Ocean using Github actions and Docker hub registry
